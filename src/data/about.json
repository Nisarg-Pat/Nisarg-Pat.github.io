    "Hi,",
    "I am a software engineer at <a href='https://www.metromobility.io/software' class='al-profile-link'>Metro Mobility</a> with 3+ years of experience. I graduated with Master of Science in Computer Science from Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts where I worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for Algorithms. I grew up in India, where I completed my Bachelors in Information and Communication Technology with minor in Computational Science from DAIICT in 2019.",
    "Post undergrad, I worked for 2 years as R&D Software Engineer at <a href='https://research.samsung.com/sri-n' class='al-profile-link'>Samsung R&D Institute</a> - Noida, India. For my contributions to the Email application at Samsung, I received <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SFHxormAz97CsKP5msPDPYTBtP2y210z/view' class='al-profile-link'>Employee of the Quarter Award</a> (July - September, 2020). I was also proud to clear the <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xiVwGOMu-B-Ha0rf9q3uHg31CFrRjWk5/view' class='al-profile-link'>Samsung Software Proficiency Exam - Professional Level.</a>",
    "In 2021, I moved to Boston to rejoice my fondness for coding. And, in the process of completing my Masters, I developed an appreciation for Distributed Systems and its application in our data centric world. Lastly, when my eyes are not buried in a screen, I love to solve puzzles, having a heartily laugh watching stand-up comics and spend time with my family."
